# Full_Stack_Web_App  

## What is this

Hi again, this time, this project was a Full Stack Web App I made as part of my assignment for the module, **ST0503 : BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT** in Singapore Polytechnic.  
If you want to check out the other projects I did as part of my school assignments, you can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/chuanhao01/Public_SP)  
Therefore, the main purpose of this repo is to mainly serve as an archive as well as some basic API documentation.  

Here are some general descriptions of the sections and quick links for you too read:
