# Getting Started

This section will mainly be focusing on the assignment this project was for.  
Such as the assignment specs, what I did and other features I included into the project.  

##  Assignment Specs

Brief description of the assignment:  
> We were supposed to develop a platform, `SnapeSell`, that would allow users to list products as listings and allow other users to make offers on these listings.
> The platform should have a front facing web page, a back-end server using the RESTful architecture, and an authentication server. 

Here were the basic required features by the assignment:  
- Front-end for the web application
- Persistent login (and logout)
- Viewing own listed products
- View Offers from other users 
- Add product listings
- Search functionality 
- Make offers for product

Here are the advanced features of the assignment:
- Pagination in the search page
- Updating and deleting the logged-in userâ€™s product listing
- Liking and unliking a product 
- Showing likes count for product when product is shown
- Provide upload of actual image for product when creating product listing
- Modify Profile info 

Luckily, I managed to implement all of these features into the project.  
Additional, I implemented other features such as: 
- Secured end points for all user API end points
- Segmentation of user controls (One user cannot access another users details)
- OAuth2 strategy for authentication
- Standard error codes and messages for API end-points
