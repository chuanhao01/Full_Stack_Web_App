# Full_Stack_Web_App  

## What is this

Hi again, this time, this project was a Full Stack Web App I made as part of my assignment for the module, **ST0503 : BACK-END WEB DEVELOPMENT** in Singapore Polytechnic.  
If you want to check out the other projects I did as part of my school assignments, you can check out the repo [here](https://github.com/chuanhao01/Public_SP)   

Therefore, the main purpose of this repo is to mainly serve as an archive as well as some basic API documentation.
